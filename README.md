## Information Gathering ##
**Maltego**- It is used for gathering information for security related work. It will save your time and make you work smarter and accurately. It will help you in the thinking process by demonstrating connected links between all the searched items. If you want to get hidden information, it(Maltego) can help you to discover it.

**Spiderfoot**- This package contains an open source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool. Its goal is to automate the process of gathering intelligence about a given target, which may be an IP address, domain name, hostname, network subnet, ASN, e-mail address or person's name

**Spiderfoot-cli**-SpiderFoot CLI (Command Line Interface) is a variant of SpiderFoot, which is an open-source tool designed for automating the process of gathering intelligence or information about a given target (which could be an IP address, domain name, hostname, network subnet, etc.). 

**theharvestor**- is a tool commonly used in penetration testing and ethical hacking, designed for gathering open-source intelligence (OSINT) about an organization or individual. It focuses on a variety of sources to collect emails, names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs related to the target. The primary purpose of theHarvester is to help security professionals in the early stages of penetration testing to understand the human element and infrastructure of their target.

## Vulnerabiliry Analysis ##
**Legion(root)**- Legion is a penetration testing and vulnerability assessment framework designed for Linux-based systems. It provides a suite of tools and scripts aimed at identifying security weaknesses and vulnerabilities within a target system. The "root" in this context likely indicates that it operates with elevated privileges, which is necessary for performing certain types of tests that require access to sensitive system resources.

**nikto**- Nikto is an open-source web server scanner that performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including potentially dangerous files/CGIs, outdated server software, and other security-related issues. It's commonly used by security professionals to identify and address vulnerabilities in web applications and servers.

**nmap**- Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful network scanning tool used for discovering hosts and services on a computer network, thus creating a map of the network's topology. It's capable of detecting open ports, identifying the operating system running on a target machine, and even deducing firewall rules. Nmap is commonly utilized in security assessments to identify potential points of entry for attackers or to conduct network inventory.

**unix-privesc-check**-This tool focuses specifically on checking for Unix/Linux privilege escalation vulnerabilities. It scans the system for potential misconfigurations, weaknesses, or outdated software that could be exploited by an attacker to escalate their privileges from a lower level (such as a regular user) to a higher level (such as root/administrator). It's particularly useful for system administrators and security professionals to ensure that systems are properly hardened against privilege escalation attacks.
